# Amazon-Echo-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP
In this project, we will predict customer sentiment using natural language processing techniques. In this project, we will build a machine learning model to analyze thousands of amazon echo reviews to predict customers sentiment. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy or not. This project is practical and directly applicable to any company with that has online presence. The algorithm could be used automatically detect customers sentiment.
